# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

My goal with this is to solve as many of these in Rust as possible.

Most solutions will likely be very inefficient. *Sorry :p*

I might come back to these later and improve the solutions, but no guarantees

Day 5 has a [separate branch](https://github.com/uzervlad/aoc2023/tree/day5-rayon) that parallelizes range calculations

Day 7 is available on a [separate branch](https://github.com/uzervlad/aoc2023/tree/day7) for *reasons*
